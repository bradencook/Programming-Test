# programming "test"

Attached is a table from one of our in progress project.  Whenever a road is completed, it is assigned a field verified date, and possibly an environmental and structural rating.  

Your task is to give us a breakdown of how many miles per day are being completed by the team, using python.  
You can use any outside libraries (numpy, pandas, etc.) to read, modify, and display the data.  We won't require arcgis for this one because its a pain to get registered with the uni, but dont let this limit the tools you use to display your results. (spreadsheets are always great, because most others in office won't want to use a terminal.)

After you've completed that, just show us what you can do.  If you can find more useful information to extrapolate from the data show us! Let this project be a judge of your abilities and your problem solving skills.

Submit to us a github repo with you script, the data source, and some documentation on how development went and how long it took.  Major bonus points for using the repo throughout development too.

let me know if you have any questions about the data set, but try and answer them yourself first :)
